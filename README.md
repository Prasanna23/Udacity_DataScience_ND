- This repository contains jupyter notebooks used for the exploration and analysis of Lending club's loan data. 
- I used approved and rejected loans datasets available in Kaggle for my analysis. 
- The dataset spiked my interest due to it's volume of 2M approved loans spanning across 2007 to 2018. 
- This is a perfect dataset to understand the lender and borrower behaviors in addition to see the regional influence of Lending club's business.
  
## Repository Files:
>LC_EDA.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with initial exploratory analysis
LC_Geographial_Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with regional analysis.
LC_Borrower_Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with my analysis on borrower behavior data

>Project1_Vizs folder contains the images of all the visualizations made out of Lending Club's dataset.
Lending_Analysis_blog.md - blog post detailing my analysis of LC data.

## Results

This analysis underscores the importance of combining regional, borrower, and macroeconomic data for informed lending. By incorporating these insights, lenders can design strategies that mitigate risk while expanding access in underserved regions. Future studies could enhance this by analyzing temporal trends or external factors such as economic shocks
